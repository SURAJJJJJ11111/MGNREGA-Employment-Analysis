# MGNREGA-Employment-Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) dataset. The project aims to evaluate the employment demand and availability across different states in India, assess the socio-economic impact of MGNREGA on various social categories, and analyze key metrics such as person-days of employment and benefits like 100 days of work completion.

The analysis includes various data processing techniques such as missing values handling, summary statistics, and visualizations to highlight trends and disparities in employment allocation, job card distribution, and government contributions.
