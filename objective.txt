## **üîπ Project Objectives**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Employment Demand vs. Availability Analysis**  
   - Analyze state-wise employment demand and actual employment provided.  
   - Identify the gap between requested and received employment opportunities.  
   - Assess regional disparities in job allocation and highlight states with the highest employment gaps.  
   - Examine trends over the years to evaluate improvements or declines in job availability.  
   - Provide insights to policymakers for optimizing job allocation and resource distribution.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Evaluate Socio-Economic Impact on Different Social Categories**  
   - Analyze the distribution of job cards among Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Categories.  
   - Assess the effectiveness of MGNREGA in promoting social inclusion.  
   - Identify disparities in job card allocation among different communities.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Analyze Employment in Terms of Person-Days Generated**  
   - Compare total person-days of employment generated by MGNREGA.  
   - Analyze state-wise contributions from the Central and State Governments.  
   - Identify states providing the highest number of person-days.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Assess Sustainable Livelihood Support (100 Days Employment & Benefits)**  
   - Identify households completing 100 days of employment.  
   - Analyze the impact of additional benefits such as land reforms and support for disabled individuals.  
   - Determine the effectiveness of MGNREGA in improving rural livelihoods.
